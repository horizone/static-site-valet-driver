# Valet driver for static php sites

I needed Laravel Valet to serve static PHP with assets just like any standard PHP hosting site. The existing example drivers for static sites that I could find was not taking into consideration that you might have site roots in subfolders too. This driver should work for all situations. No warranties ofcourse.
